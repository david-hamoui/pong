# pong
Very, very simple version of Pong. There's no way of winning or losing, just pass the time bouncing the ball around.

To play, just download the code and run it in Processing 3.


Click on either button on the top left to make the game go faster or slower.

*There's a bug that when the ball misses the platform, the game doesn't stop sometimes. Relaunch the script to restart.
